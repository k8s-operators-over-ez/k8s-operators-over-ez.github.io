### Story (BDD/Gherkin Style)

**TITLE**: Overeasy Operator Requirements

- **DESCRIPTION**
    - **AS A**: Developer
    - **I WANT**: An Operator with a single busybox pod that logs a user specified message and shuts down after a user specified amount of time. If a duration or message are not specified, then both will be supplied by a REST API call. 
    - **SO THAT**: I can demonstrate the encapsulation of operational knowlege, leveraging the Operator Design Pattern.  

- **SCENARIO 1**: Shutdown the busybox pod after a user specified amount of time in seconds
  - **GIVEN**: An Operator instance
  - **WHEN**: the specification `timeout` is set to a numeric value in seconds
  - **THEN**: the busy box pod will remain available for the specified `timeout` duration in seconds,

- **SCENARIO 2**: Log a user specified message before shutting down the busybox pod
  - **GIVEN**: An Operator instance
  - **WHEN**: the specification `message` is set to a string value
  - **THEN**: the busy box pod will log the message, from the `message` specification after the `timeout` duration has expired. 

- **SCENARIO 3**: Retrieve the `timeout` and `message` from a given REST API if one and/or the other is not supplied. 
  - **GIVEN**: An Operator instance
  - **WHEN**: the specification `message` OR `timeout` is NOT set
  - **THEN**: the busy box pod will supply these values from the following REST API: `GET http://my-json-server.typicode.com/keunlee/test-rest-repo/golang-lab00-response`

- **SCENARIO 4**: Update status `expired` and `logged` when the busybox pod has expired
  - **GIVEN**: An Operator instance
  - **WHEN**: the busy box pod's duration has expired
  - **AND**: the busy box pod has logged a message
  - **THEN**: set the operators `expired` status to `true`
  - **AND**: set the operators `logged` status to `true`

### Acceptance Criteria Notes

- The CRD must have a `timeout` specification attribute
- The Operator instance must shut down after the duration of `timeout` in seconds, has been reached
- The CRD must have a `message` specification attribute
- The Operator instance must log the message `message` before the container has stopped
- The CRD must have a `expired` status attribute
- The Operator must set the status of the busy box pod upon expiration, `expired`
- The CRD must have a `logged` status attribute
- The Operator must set the status of the busy box pod when logging a message, `logged`
- The Operator instance must retrieve a `message` and `timeout` value from a REST API call (`GET http://my-json-server.typicode.com/keunlee/test-rest-repo/golang-lab00-response`), if both are not initially supplied on the Operator Instance. 

## Execution Strategy

In a nutshell, we want our operator to start up a pod, running a busybox image for a specific duration and logging a user specific message, and then setting our Operator's status. 

We'll want our Operator to provision our busybox pod with the necessary attribute specifications, eventually. 

Our strategy to reach the end state is detailed as followed: 

![](/assets/execution-strategy.png)

- **I - Prototyping** - Create a YAML specification for a pod which runs for a specified amount of time and logs a specific message. Do this to validate our design. We'll eventually want our Operator controller implementation to dynamically set the pods timeout duration and log message. For now, we will validate our prototype. 

- **II - Operator Scaffolding** - Scaffold a Golang Operator to give us an initial template for our CRD and Resource Controller

- **III - CR Definition Implementation** - Add properties for your Custom Resources Specifications and Status attributes. 

- **IV - TDD Setup** - Create a Unit Test file for our Custom Resource Controller to validate our requirements leveraging TDD (Test Driven Design). We will validate the tests as we implement our controller. 

- **V - CR Controller Implementation**- Implement our Resource Controller logic to help fulfill the Story and Acceptance Criteria.

- **VI - Test Validation** - Validate our Unit Tests. Sanity check our Operator so that it is indeed operating as intended. 

- **VII - Deployment** - Deploy the Operator to your Kubernetes cluster
